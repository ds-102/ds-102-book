# Content with notebooks

You can also create content with Jupyter Notebooks. The content for the current page is contained
in a Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder of the repository. This means that we can include
code blocks and their outputs, and export them to Jekyll markdown.

**You can find the original notebook for this page [at this address](https://github.com/jupyter/textbooks-with-jupyter/blob/master/notebooks/introduction/notebooks.ipynb)**

## Markdown + notebooks

As it is markdown, you can embed images, HTML, etc into your posts!

You an also $add_{math}$ and

$$
math^{blocks}
$$

or

$$
\begin{align*}
\mbox{mean} la_{tex} \\ \\
math blocks
\end{align*}
$$

But make sure you \$Escape \$your \$dollar signs \$you want to keep!

## Code blocks and image outputs

Textbooks with Jupyter will also embed your code blocks and output in your site.
For example, here's some sample Matplotlib code:

from matplotlib import rcParams, cycler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
plt.ion()

# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)

N = 10
data = [np.logspace(0, 1, 100) + np.random.randn(100) + ii for ii in range(N)]
data = np.array(data).T
cmap = plt.cm.coolwarm
rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler(color=cmap(np.linspace(0, 1, N)))


from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
custom_lines = [Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(0.), lw=4),
                Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(.5), lw=4),
                Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(1.), lw=4)]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
lines = ax.plot(data)
ax.legend(custom_lines, ['Cold', 'Medium', 'Hot']);

Note that the image above is captured and displayed by Jekyll.

## Removing content before publishing

You can also remove some content before publishing your book to the web. For example,
in [the original notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/blob/master/notebooks/introduction/notebooks.ipynb) there
used to be a cell below...

# HIDDEN
thisvariable = "none of this should show up in the textbook"

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.random.randn(100)
y = np.random.randn(100)
ax.scatter(x, y, s=np.abs(x*100), c=x, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
ax.text(0, .5, thisvariable, fontsize=20, transform=ax.transAxes)
ax.set_axis_off()

You can also **remove only the code** so that images and other output still show up.

Below we'll *only* display an image. It was generated with Python code in a cell,
which you can [see in the original notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/blob/master/notebooks/introduction/notebooks.ipynb)

# NO CODE
thisvariable = "this plot *will* show up in the textbook."

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.random.randn(100)
y = np.random.randn(100)
ax.scatter(x, y, s=np.abs(x*100), c=x, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
ax.text(0, .5, thisvariable, fontsize=20, transform=ax.transAxes)
ax.set_axis_off()

And here we'll *only* display a Pandas DataFrame. Again, this was generated with Python code
from [this original notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/textbooks-with-jupyter/blob/master/notebooks/introduction/notebooks.ipynb).

# NO CODE
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame([['hi', 'there'], ['this', 'is'], ['a', 'DataFrame']], columns=['Word A', 'Word B'])

You can configure the text that *Textbooks with Jupyter* uses for this by modifying your site's `_config.yml` file.

## Interactive outputs

We can even do the same for *interactive* material. Below we'll display a map using `ipyleaflet`. When the notebook
is converted to Markdown, the code for creating the interactive map is retained.

**Note that this will only work for some packages.** They need to be able to output standalone HTML/Javascript, and not
depend on an underlying Python kernel to work.

import folium

m = folium.Map(
    location=[45.372, -121.6972],
    zoom_start=12,
    tiles='Stamen Terrain'
)

folium.Marker(
    location=[45.3288, -121.6625],
    popup='Mt. Hood Meadows',
    icon=folium.Icon(icon='cloud')
