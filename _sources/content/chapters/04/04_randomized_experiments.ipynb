In other words, knowing the treatment decision $Z_i$ always gives us information about *which* of the two potential outcomes ($Y_i(0)$ or $Y_i(1)$) we observed (except in the uninteresting scenario where the treatment is completely unrelated to the outcome), but\n",

This is the pair of potential outcomes, $\\big(Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\\big)$. Next, consider the treatment decision $Z_i$: this represents whether the subject got the vaccine ($Z_i = 1$) or a placebo ($Z_i = 0$).

Recall that in this setting, we assume that $Z_i$ (which we observe) is random, but that $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ (which are unknown) are fixed. In this case, the statement of independence above doesn't really make sense, since $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ are not random. However, we can still compute the Neyman estimator.

    "\n",
    "The first is a much stricter null hypothesis (hence the name \"strong null\"), since it states that all the treatment effects are 0. The second is looser, requiring only that the treatment effects average out to 0. Because of this, the strong null is often easier to reject.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test a hypothesis against Neyman's weak null, we construct the test statistic $\\frac{\\hat{\\tau}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{V}}}$. Under the Neyman weak null hypothesis, this should follow a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test a hypothessis against Fisher's strong null, we need some stronger mathematical machinery. We'll limit ourself to cases where the treatment and outcome are both binary, and use a technique called **permutation testing**. In this technique, we randomly shuffle the treatment/control labels, and use that to build a null distribution for the difference in outcomes (for a refresher on this technique, see the [Data 8 textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/1/AB_Testing.html)). Instead of randomly shuffling, however, Fisher's exact test instead looks at every single possible permutation, and computes a $p$-value in closed form."

We find that the videos have no effect: everyone in our sample does an excellent job of evaluation, regardless of whether or not they watched the video.\n",
