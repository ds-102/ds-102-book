    "To understand causality, let's explore the meaning of the word \"cause\". Consider the following sentences: all of them use words like \"causes\" or \"because\", and they are all valid sentences in modern English, but the meaning of \"cause\" is slightly different in each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The soccer ball moved because I kicked it.\n",
    "2. The couple broke up because one of them moved to another country.\n",
    "3. I am who I am today because of my parents.\n",
    "4. Gravity causes objects to fall to the Earth.\n",
    "5. Down Syndrome is caused by having 3 copies of chromosome 21.\n",
    "6. Humans burning fossil fuels is causing climate change.\n",
    "7. Barbarian invasions caused the Roman Empire to fall.\n",
    "8. Smoking causes lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern understanding of the word \"cause\" aligns with what the Greek philosopher Aristotle called \"agent\" or \"efficient\" cause: where one agent or object brings about change in another. Taking a closer look at the examples above, if we limit ourselves to this understanding, we should eliminate sentences 3 and 4. In sentence 3, the thing being \"caused\" is \"who I am today\", which doesn't fall under the idea of a \"change\". Similarly, in sentence 4, the thing doing the causing is \"gravity\", which isn't a specific thing or object, but rather a conceptual physical theory. Note that this is a subjective determination!\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about cause is to divide the statements above into *deterministic* and *probabilistic* cause. What do these mean? If A is a deterministic cause of B, then whenever A happens, B must happen. In contrast, if A is a probabilistic cause of B, then whenever A happens, the probability of B increases. Going back to our examples above, sentences 1, 5, and 6 are all statements of deterministic causality. This doesn't mean that the causality in the remaining sentences (2, 7, and 8) isn't real! For example, consider statement 7: most historians believe that the Roman Empire was in a prolonged state of decline before the barbarian invasions. However, those invasions still had a real, tangible impact on the empire's fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other ways of thinking about causality: for example, we can divide the statements above into instance causality and class causality; single cause and multiple cause; simple action and compound action; and much more."

To help us answer this question, consider the following thought experiment: imagine yourself in two parallel universes. In Universe 1, you took the aspirin. In Universe 0, you didn't take the aspirin. If your fever improved by the same amount in both universes, then that seems like strong evidence that the aspirin did *not* cause your fever to go down. On the other hand, if your fever went down in Universe 1 and not in Universe 0, then that seems like strong evidence that the aspirin *did* cause your fever to go down.\n",

In any real-world data, we only get to observe one of these: in the example above, if you decided to take the aspirin, then you would only ever observe $Y(1)$. For this reason, the other universe is often called the **counterfactual** universe.
