During a lull, when the virus is less common in the population, we should expect a relatively small number of people with COVID, and a relatively large number of healthy patients. This means that some moderate percentage of positive tests will be incorrect (false positives), and so our FDR could be moderately high. But during a surge in cases, many more people are sick, and we should expect more of the positive tests to come from people with COVID rather than healthy people. Therefore, our FDP will be lower, even if the test itself stays exactly the same.\n",
