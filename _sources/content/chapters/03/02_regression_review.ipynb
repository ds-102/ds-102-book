Note that we are treating $X$ as fixed and known, so there's no probability model associated with it. We'll generally focus on this version, rather than the previous one\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about the implicit assumptions we're making by choosing a normal likelihood. Recall that under a normal distribution, we're very unlikely to see values more than 3$\\sigma$ away from the mean. That means that we're implicitly assuming that the vast majority of $y$-values we see will be within 3$\\sigma$ of the average prediction prediction $X\\beta$. This helps explain why linear regression is sensitive to outliers: the likelihood of a point very far away from the average prediction is very small, but the likelihood of several points all somewhat far away is much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is often referred to as **ordinary least squares, or OLS**.\n",

    "Under this model, one reasonable way to estimate $\\beta$ is to choose the value that maximizes the likelihood. When choosing a value of $\\beta$ to maximize the likelihood, we note that we don't actually care about the normalizing constant in the normal distribution. So, we can write:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we've found that maximizing the Gaussian likelihood of the data is exactly equivalent to minimizing the squared loss. This is true in general for regression problems: we can arrive at the same answer by either choosing a loss function and minimizing it, or choosing a corresponding likelihood and maximizing it.\n",

    "### Uncertainty in Regression Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that when making a prediction for a new data point, there are multiple sources of uncertainty. Recall that our model states that $\\hat{y} = X\\hat{\\beta} + \\epsilon$. When making a prediction, we have some uncertainty the first term $X\\hat{\\beta}$, because the coefficients we estimate depend on the random data. We also have additional uncertainty from the second term, depending on how much variability the model estimates in the data around the average predictions."
