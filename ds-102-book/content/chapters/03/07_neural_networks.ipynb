    "As we've already seen, linear regression is a simple but powerful model: to predict a value $y$ from a vector of features $x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_k)$, linear regression uses the following:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "y = Wx + b\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Here, $W$ is a vector of coefficients, sometimes also called **weights**, and $b$ is a scalar that we call the intercept or bias. As we saw in the previous section, linear models can fail when the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is nonlinear. We also saw that if we want to model complex, nonlinear interactions *while still using linear models*, we need to define more complex features.\n",

We then apply linear regression with those features, using the weights in the vector $W_2$ and intercept/bias in the scalar $b_2$, to obtain $y$.\n",

Let's try to write these partial derivatives on the graph, and see if we can use them to keep working backwards.\n",

So, we'll take advantage of the chain rule and multiply by the \"derivative so far\": that's just $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q}$ = 16.

We multiply that with what we have so far, 16, to get 48.\n",
