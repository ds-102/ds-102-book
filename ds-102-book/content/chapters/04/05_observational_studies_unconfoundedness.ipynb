    "* **Ethical considerations**: suppose we believe that a certain treatment might harm people. In order to test this belief in a randomized controlled trial, we would have to subject people to a treatment that we believe would harm them, which is profoundly unethical. In such cases, we need alternative ways of drawing causal conclusions: we have an obligation as data scientists and researchers to avoid making [the mistakes of the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States).\n",

Note that although this is the same logistic regression you're familiar with, the purpose of using it is very different: here, we aren't trying to make predictions, or achieve high prediction accuracy.
