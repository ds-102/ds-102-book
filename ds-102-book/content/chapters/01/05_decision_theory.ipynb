    "Up until now, we've used error rates to help us understand tradeoffs in binary decision-making. In this section, we'll introduce a more general theoretical framework to understand and quantify errors we make, and start to explore the theoretical branch of statistics known as **statistical decision theory**.\n",

    "Remember our setup: we have some **unknown quantity** $\\theta$ that we're interested in. We collect data $x$. Our data are random, and come from the distribution $p(x|\\theta)$. We use the data to reason about $\\theta$. Often, we'll want to use the data to compute an estimate for $\\theta$ but sometimes, we may want to do something slightly different. In order to describe \"the thing we do to the data\", we'll use the notation $\\delta(x)$. This represents the result of applying some procedure $\\delta$ to the data. For example, $\\delta$ might be the sample average of many data points, or the result of logistic regression. The obvious next question is: how do we choose which procedure $\\delta$ to use? We'll decide by quantifying how \"good\" each $\\delta$ is, and then trying to choose the \"best\" one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good\" is a very abstract notion: to quantify it, we'll need a quantitative measure of how good (or to be more precise, how bad) our procedure $\\delta$ is. We'll call this a **loss function**. Notationally, we'll write $\\ell(\\theta, \\delta(x))$ to represent the loss associated with the outcome $\\delta(x)$ if the true value is $\\theta$.
