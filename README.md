# Lecture Notes for Data 102

Notes for contributing to this repository:

- The content is in the directory called: `./content`. That is the directory where all Markdown and Notebook files should be put into.

- The Table of Contents file is at `_data/toc.yml`.

- The configuration file is at `_config.yml`.

- The `content/features` directory showcases a few features of the Jupyter Books tool which for now we'll leave in place until we're all familiar with them (like input/code hiding, etc).
